    <p> Hello all! My name is Kyler and I am 21 years old. I was going to school for chemical engineering and then I decided to change my course to computer Programming!
        I live in harrisburg PA, and attended HACC for 2 years before I decided to change my major. I am a musician (well kinda). I am a drummer I have been drumming since I was about 6 years old.
        I enjoy all kinds of music, and I also enjoy hiking and rock climbing as my hobbies!
